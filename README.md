# SSM Secrets Webhook

Inspired by the awesome work of the Banzai Cloud team on the [Vault Secrets Webhook](https://banzaicloud.com/blog/inject-secrets-into-pods-vault-revisited/), this is a stripped down and repurposed version of the K8s mutating webhook replacing Hashicorp Vault with AWS SSM as the data source.
